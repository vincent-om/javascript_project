* Recording of the amount of milk produced per shade each day

* Calculation of the average weekly revenues generated from sales of milk

The service also provides a means through which one can predict the amount of earnings expected when a certain expected price is inputted in the system. This would help in planning and making informed decision. There is also a What If analyss where one can compare the amount of revenues the would have earned if price was set at a certain value. This is compared with what is currently being earned thus providing in-depth information about the state of affairs in the farm
